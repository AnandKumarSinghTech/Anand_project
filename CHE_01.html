            <img src="greenhouse_effect_img-removebg-preview.png" alt="Greenhouse Effect Illustration" class="intro-image">
            <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural mechanism that heats the Earth's surface and is thus necessary for a life-supporting temperature on the planet. This process takes place when the sun's energy reaches Earth, some of which is absorbed by the surface, heating it, and then is gradually radiated back to space as infrared heat. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and water vapor, collect some of this heat, prevent its escape into space, and thus, keep the atmosphere warm enough to support life.
                In the absence of the greenhouse effect, the average temperature on this planet would be −1°C, thereby making the environment really hard on the majority of the forms of life living currently. Although the earth's climate changes naturally over long periods of time resulting in a nominal increase in the temperature of the atmosphere, human activities in recent centuries, especially since the Industrial Revolution have been the major driving force of the atmospheric GHG levels

            <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
            <h3>1. Carbon Dioxide</h3>
            <img src="Carbon-dioxide.jpg" alt="Carbon Dioxide Molecule" class="gas-image">
            <p>Sources: While CO₂ results chiefly from combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), deforestation, cement production, and manufacturing processes.</p>
            <p>Impact: CO₂, the most prevalent and long-lived GHG, produced as a result of various human activities, remains in the atmosphere for centuries and is a major driver of global warming. It has led to an increase in average global temperatures, ocean acidification, and intensified weather conditions.</p>

            <h3>2. Methane</h3>
            <p>Sources: Livestock digestion and manure management, landfills, coal mining, oil and natural gas extraction, and rice paddies are the main sources of methane.</p>
            <p>Impact: While methane is less abundant than CO₂, it is more than 25 times better than CO₂ at trapping heat over a hundred years. With a shorter atmospheric lifespan of about 12 years, a reduction in methane emissions means that it will contribute much faster to overall cooling.</p>
            
            <h3>3.Nitrous Oxide</h3>
            <p>Sources: Emissions arise mainly from agricultural and industrial activities pertaining to synthetic fertilizer use and livestock waste; they originate from fossil fuel combustion and certain industrial processes as well.</p>
            <p>Impact: It is roughly 300 times as effective at trapping heat as CO₂ over a 100-year scale. Contribution to the warming of the planet; destruction of the ozone layer responsible for the protection of life on earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <h3>1. Early Scientific Development (19th Century)</h3>
            <p>Joseph Fourier (1820s): In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician, introduced the idea of the greenhouse effect.</p>
            <p>John Tyndall (1859): John Tyndall, an Irish physicist, continued Fourier's ideas and worked through an experimental approach to identify which gases trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Svante Arrhenius (1896): Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was the first to quantitatively estimate the effect of changes in CO₂ concentrations on the temperature of the Earth.</p>

            <h3>2. The Industrial Revolution and Emissions (18th-19th Centuries)</h3>
            <img src="industary.jpg" alt="Industrial Revolution Factories" class="context-image">
            <p>The late 18th century saw the rise of the Industrial Revolution. Coal, especially, was being used, with increasing popularity, well into the 19th century and beyond. CO₂ emissions increased massively from coal burning and, later, from burning oil and natural gas.</p>

            <h3>3. The Growing Awareness of the 20th Century</h3>
            <p>1930s-1950s: Gaining Traction for Global Warming Theories</p>
            <p>Charles David Keeling (1958): Keeling is credited with the development of the Keeling curve, a representation of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

            <h3>4. From Kyoto Protocol to Paris Agreement: A Synoptic View (1997-Present)</h3>
            <img src="paris agriment.png" alt="Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement" class="context-image">
            <p><b>1997: The Kyoto Protocol</b></p>
            <p>The Kyoto Protocol establishes legally binding limits on industrialized countries for the reduction of emissions. It was the first international treaty that required reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions of climate concerning CO₂ and certain other important GHGs. 
                Although it was a milestone, it became almost impotent in terms of being effective, mostly attributed to the withdrawal of some vital countries, with the U.S. on the forefront</p>
            <p><b>2015: The Paris Agreement</b></p>
            <p>The Paris Agreement sets voluntary limits on emissions in both developed and developing countries. It sets forth ambitious, concrete commitments toward limiting global warming to well below 2°C, while further aiming to restrict the temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.</p>

            <h2>Current Global Challenges</h2>
            <img src="climate.jpg" alt="challenge"class="context-image">
            <h3>1. Rising Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
            <p>While there are global congenial endeavors to reduce emissions, yet still it is on the rise on account of industrialization, 
                increased energy consumption, deforestation, and agricultural practice. CO₂ remains the major greenhouse gas, the emission of 
                which is going up as a result of a wide proliferation of fossil fuel use for transportation, electricity generation, and industrial processes.</p>

            <h3>2. Global Warming and Rising Temperatures</h3>
            <p>The Earth has experienced a warming of about 1.2°C globally since before the industrial era. Most of this warming is due to the 
                growth in the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. Increased temperatures have resulted in widespread changes in ecosystems, 
                agriculture, water, and health.</p>

            <h3>3. Melting Ice Caps and Rising Sea Levels</h3>
            <p>Rising temperatures speed up the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. The loss of ice in regions like Greenland and Antarctica
                 causes sea levels to rise and threatens ecosystems and communities surrounding coastlines and islands.</p>

            <h3>4. Ocean Acidification</h3>
            <p>The oceans soak up about one-quarter of the CO2 emitted due to human actions, thus leading to this phenomenon termed ocean acidification. 
                Dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water and forms carbonic acid. This lowers the pH in the oceans, and in turn, marine ecosystems 
                that include coral reefs, shellfish, as well as other marine life that is dependent on calcium carbonate to form their shells and skeletons are 
                being modified</p>

            <h3>5. Deforestation and Land Use Change</h3>
            <p>Deforestation and land cover alteration especially in the tropical moist forests have remained some of the leading sources of C02. While trees and forests 
                are carbon sinks which sequester carbon dioxide in large quantities, this carbon gets released back to the environment when forested areas are converted 
                to agriculture, mining or towns.</p>

            <h3>6. Climate Change and Health</h3>
            <p>The rising temperatures are on the rise of the heat-related medical conditions such as heat strokes, respiratory issues, and other similar cases. Different 
                vulnerable groups who include the old individuals, young ones or even sick people with other health challenges will be highly affected.</p>

            <h3>7. Economic and Social Inequality</h3>
            <p>The impacts of climate change are felt increasingly by the poor and marginalised population who have fewer opportunities to defend the changes. These populations 
                are also mostly found in flood plain areas, drought-stricken, or heatwave communities with little or no access to health care and emergency services</p>

        <section id="Scope">
            <h2>Scope and objectives of the report</h2>
            <p>Scope of the Report Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change In this part, the writer will explore in detail what greenhouse gases are, how they are found in the atmosphere of the Earth, and the system within which they are classified and cause global warming. It will illustrate the various types of GHGs (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated compounds)
                 as well as the processes that produce them, both naturally and through human activities.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <img src="earths.png" alt="Conclusion Illustration" class="conclusion-image">
            <p>The greenhouse gas emission effect is one of the most important environmental problems that the world is facing today. Global warming is directly related to the fact that the level of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is increasing with time. It breeds numerous problems, which include enhanced global temperatures, occurrences of extreme climatic conditions, rise in sea levels, as well as disturbance to both the environment and the society.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the situation of greenhouse gas emissions is not a lost cause. There is much that can be done to reduce the impacts of climate change, even if it would take a concerted global effort. Transitioning to alternative energy, enhancing energy efficiency, practicing climate smart agriculture, and conserving forests and other carbon storages are necessary steps toward reducing emissions.</p>
